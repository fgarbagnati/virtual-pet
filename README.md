Simple virtual pet game. [Play it here](https://infinite-plateau-38416.herokuapp.com/)

Keep your virtual pet alive!

Move pet by dragging and dropping him. You can feed him, give him a toy or play with him using the icons on the bottom. To give him an item, choose the item and drop it on the screen (your pet will find his way to the item).

Keep him healthy and entertained! Apples will boost his health and giving him a toy or spinning him around will boost his fun stats. Candy also makes him happy, but don't go overboard because it's too unhealthy!

Have fun!
